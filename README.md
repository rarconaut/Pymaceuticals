# Pymaceuticals

Pymaceuticals is a Python project simulating the analysis of pharmaceutical data from drug trials on mice for treatments for squamous cell carcinoma (SCC).

In this study, 249 mice identified with SCC were treated with a 45 day course of a variety of drug regimens. Tumor development was observed and measured, in terms of:
<ul><li>Weight</li>
  <li>Tumor Volume</li>
  <li>And number of Metastatic Sites</li></ul>

The purpose of this study was to compare the performance of the various drugs and create a summary of the study results. Pandas was used to create the dataframes to manipulate and analyze the data (ie. calculate the summary statistics).
